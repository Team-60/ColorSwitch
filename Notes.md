# Notes

## Bonus Ideas
- Settings, play music, night mode
- Leaderboard
- Supercharge, obstacle blast, high frequency sound ?? (better with sideline collection of balls)
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31866814/javafx-multithreading-flashing-lights effects ??

## Ideas
- Obstacle, Star, SwitchColor inheriting abstract GameElements
- ObstacleTypes inheriting abstract Obstacle
- GameElements, CheckCollision, Action, Offset 
- ~~Generic could be implemented for game screens, Main game screen, Load game~~
- Layout with fxml, transitions through changing scenes
- Classes like Main Game screen and Load game not necessary and can be implemented better with fxml, instead things like Database would be a good idea
- A class with its controller methods are intertwined, load corresponding fxml in class and handle in controller
- Maintain midLine, highScoreLine

## Misc
- Threading
- Transitions could be done via Scene replacement in a single stage
- maintain .gitignore

## Classes
* ~~MainPage : New Game, Load Game, Exit Game~~
* ~~LoadGamePage ?~~
* Game
* GameElements (Interface / Class) ?
* Ball
* Obstacle
* Star
* SwitchColor
* ~~PauseGamePage ?~~
* ~~EndGamePage ?~~
* LeaderBoard

## TODO
* Understand code workflow (b)
* Exceptions / Interfaces / Generic 
* Ask bhavya/osheen on how to get gifs/assets
