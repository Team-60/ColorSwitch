# Notes

## Bonus Ideas
- Settings, play music, night mode
- Leaderboard
- Supercharge, obstacle blast, high frequency sound ??
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31866814/javafx-multithreading-flashing-lights effects ??

## Ideas
- Obstacle, Star, SwitchColor inhereting abstract GameElements
- ObstacleTypes inheriting abstract Obstacle
- GameElements, CheckCollision, Action, Offset 
- Generic could be implemented for game screens, Main game screen, Load game
- Layout with fxml, transitions through changing scenes
- Classes like Main Game screen and Load game not necessary and can be implemented better with fxml, instead things like Database would be a good idea

## Misc
- Threading
- Transitions could be done via Scene replacement in a single stage
- Use git only for the 'src' folder in Intellij, terminal preferred

## Classes
* MainPage : New Game, Load Game, Exit Game
* LoadGamePage ?
* Game
* GameElements (Interface / Class) ?
* Ball
* Obstacle
* Star
* SwitchColor
* PauseGamePage ?
* EndGamePage ?
* LeaderBoard

## TODO
* Understand code workflow (b)
* Exceptions / Interfaces / Generic 
* Ask bhavya/osheen on how to get gifs/assets
